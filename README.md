# ECS-Workshop
Hi, welcome to the Unity Meetup Workshop on ECS!

## Before the Workshop
Ideally before the workshop you've:
- Installed `Unity 2022.3.6f1`
- Tried opening the project `/Course-of-a-Boat`
  - (this ensures a quick project launch on the day)

## Slides
After the workshop, slides will, _hopefully_, be posted here in the repository ;)

That should be it, ***cya there!***
